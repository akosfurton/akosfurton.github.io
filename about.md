title: About Me
---

I am a Data Science student studying Business Analytics at [Imperial College](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-business-analytics/) in London. 

I have always been fascinated by technology and using data to interpret information and make decisions. I want to use this blog as a portfolio to showcase the data science skills I learned. Highlighted works will include both coursework and personal data analysis. 

Before studying at Imperial College, I studied [Mathematics](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/) and [Supply Chain Management](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Departments/IROM) at The University of Texas at Austin. During that time, I was a part of [Texas 4000](http://www.texas4000.org/), a nonprofit that raises money for cancer research through a 4000 mile bicycle ride from Austin, Texas to Anchorage, Alaska. I have also spent semesters studying at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) and at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).
